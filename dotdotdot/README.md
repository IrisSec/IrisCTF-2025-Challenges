# dotdotdot - Radio Frequency

Welcome to this year's RF category! Here's the usual legal disclaimer yada yada:

**We are not lawyers. We're not your lawyers. This isn't legal advice.**

When playing with radios, never transmit unless you know what you're doing. Always check your local laws and legislations before you transmit. In the United States, unauthorized transmission outside of certain frequency bands is illegal and can even be considered a felony offense in some cases. Radio frequency is cool, but don't get in trouble!

You do not need to transmit for any of these challenges. You do not need any radio hardware for any of these challenges. All of these challenges were made to be solved without the need for real-life hardware.

This disclaimer isn't meant to deter. It's meant to educate and communicate that you should educate yourself on the specific legalities for your locality if you want to dive into the world of RF. Once again, this is not legal advice, and you do not need to transmit for any of these challenges.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's start with a simple challenge to prove some basic competency before we get into the more advanced stuff. This challenge will unlock the rest of the RF category.

I picked up this transmission, but it's way too noisy to make any sense of it. Can you give it a shot?
