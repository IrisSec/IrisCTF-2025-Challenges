I didn't eat much on the plane. Airplane food has always left a pit in my stomach. I usually eat before my flight or buy a couple of sandwiches before I board. 

But this ramen tasted so good. I don’t know if I was just hungry, but I slurped that noodle and downed the broth. It was really hard to find a place to sit and it was uncomfortably packed. It would be nice if the restaurant could move to a bigger space to accommodate for luggage and seating space. I don’t feel uncomfortable having my luggage outside the restaurant.
