It was bum hot outside, so I decided to cool off at a beignet spot after a business meeting. Since it was mid-afternoon, the place was nearly empty.

The cashier greeted me warmly as I walked in, and I ordered the Berry Berry. While waiting, I peered through a large window into the kitchen to watch the beignets being made. When my order arrived, I was surprised by the large portion size. The assortment of berries and the generous amount of jam were delightful. Although the whipped cream was a bit much on my sweet tooth, it still paired well with the beignets. Thankfully, there was a water station nearby, which helped washed out the sweetness.

I wouldn’t come back alone, but I’d definitely return with a friend to share the portions with.
