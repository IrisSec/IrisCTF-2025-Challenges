I visited my friend in Japan, and we had some decent crepes! The area was bustling with foot traffic, so we expected a long wait, but it ended up being okay. I’m usually not a fan of yogurt in my crepes, but I was content with it.

Finding a seat was difficult because the place was crowded, and walking elsewhere to eat wasn’t an option, as it’s culturally considered rude to eat while walking in Japan.
