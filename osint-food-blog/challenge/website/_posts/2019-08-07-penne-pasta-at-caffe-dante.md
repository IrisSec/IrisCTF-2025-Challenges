I enjoyed the flavor of the penne pasta from Caffe Dante, but I wish they had added more sauce—it felt like they skimped on it. We also fell for a tourist trap. My friend wanted to try their regular-sized mocktail, but the waiter claimed it was too small. She ended up ordering the extra-large size and was charged €30. We should’ve checked the menu and canceled the drink, but honestly, who charges that much for a mocktail?."
