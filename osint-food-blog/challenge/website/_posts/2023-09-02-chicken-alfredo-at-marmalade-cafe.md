I was in the area and decided to try this café chain since I’d heard a lot about it. The atmosphere felt a bit dull, and the floor looked like it hadn’t been swept in a while, but it might have just been a temporary lapse.

The food took a little longer than expected, but I didn’t mind since I was nursing my orange juice while waiting. The portion size was reasonable, and I appreciated the sauce’s consistency. However, I was disappointed by how dry the chicken was.
