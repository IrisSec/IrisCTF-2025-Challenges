I don’t usually like spending time in the casino because cigarette smoke tends to trigger my allergies.

The Peking duck salad was quite good—I especially enjoyed the dressing and fresh vegetables paired with the duck. The price of the salad is debatable, given that they used a citrus truffle dressing. While I thought it was good, it’s not something I’d go out of my way to eat again. There’s also a business casual dress code, which I understand, but it’s not exactly a place I’d choose to dine alone again.
